# wunderlist-BE
Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.
